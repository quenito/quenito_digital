💡 BRAIN ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
🚨 CRITICAL: Low automation rate detected
   → Increase brain learning data through more manual interventions
   → Review and enhance question pattern recognition
   → Consider lowering confidence thresholds for learning mode
   → TrustRatingHandler: Requires immediate brain enhancement
🧠 Brain evolution enhancement:
   → Implement more sophisticated learning algorithms
   → Increase pattern recognition sensitivity
   → Enhance success pattern storage mechanisms
🎓 Brain development focus:
   → Complete Phase 1A demographics mastery
   → Accumulate at least 10 successful interventions
   → Establish baseline confidence calibration
